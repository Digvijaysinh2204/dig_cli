# Structure

A "Proper" Flutter project template generated by **DIG CLI**.

## 🛠️ Features

- ✅ **Standardized Directory Structure**
- ✅ **Automated Android Signing (JKS)**
- ✅ **Firebase Skeleton Configuration**
- ✅ **Rebranded Package & Bundle IDs**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Firebase Configuration (Recommended)

This project is pre-configured with Firebase skeletons. To enable Push Notifications and Analytics, you **MUST** configure Firebase for your specific project:

1. **Install FlutterFire CLI**: `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`
2. **Configure Project**: Run `flutterfire configure` and follow the prompts. This will update your `firebase_options.dart`.
3. **Optional**: Add `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) if required by your specific configuration.

### 2. Run without Firebase

The app is built to be **robust**. Even if you don't configure Firebase, the app will still run! 
- Startup errors will be caught and logged.
- Core features (navigation, API calls, theme, etc.) will work perfectly.
- Only Firebase-dependent features (like notifications) will be disabled.

### 3. Install Dependencies & Run

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
